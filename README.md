# Youth-Risk-Behavior-Surveillance-System-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) dataset 
to uncover trends in health-risk behaviors among middle school students in the United States. 
The focus is on Physical Activity, Mental Health, Substance Use, and Violence.

The goal is to transform raw survey data into meaningful insights using SQL (BigQuery) 
for querying and Power BI for visualization. The project also explores demographic and temporal 
trends to support data-driven decision-making in public health and education.
